Permission Disptacher library in java. This project is on the lines with the permission dispatcher library created by hotchemi.
Unlike the original permission dispatcher processor which is coded in kotlin. This processor is entirely in Java converted from the original kotlin of permission dispatcher. People who vary of kotlin and dont want to use library in their project can readily opt for this library and integrate it as inpendent module within their existing project. Its just plug and play.

Import the both annotation lib and processor as separate modules into your application and voila you are good to go.

All the sample code and guidelines on how to use annotation in your application are similar to hotchemi.

So for further information on how to use the annotation refer home page https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher
